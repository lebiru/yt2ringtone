Method 1: Using GarageBand
Create or Transfer the Ringtone File:

Ensure the ringtone file is in .m4r format and is less than 40 seconds long. If it's not, you might need to edit and convert it using a computer or an app.
Transfer the ringtone file to your iPhone. You can use email, cloud storage, or direct file transfer from your computer.
Import into GarageBand:

Open GarageBand on your iPhone. If you don't have it, it's free to download from the App Store.
Create a new project and select the Audio Recorder tool.
Tap on the "View" button (looks like a brick wall) to enter the multitrack editor.
Tap the Loop Browser (loop icon) and select the "Files" tab.
Find your ringtone file (you might need to import it from your Files app).
Drag and drop the ringtone onto the timeline.
Share as Ringtone:

Once the file is in GarageBand, tap and hold the project to bring up the sharing options.
Select "Share" and then "Ringtone".
Name your ringtone and tap "Export".
Set as Ringtone:

Go to "Settings" > "Sounds & Haptics" > "Ringtone" on your iPhone.
Your new ringtone should appear in the list of available ringtones.
